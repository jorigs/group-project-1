Concept: 
Spotty is a program that helps users find their ideal studdy / work spot in their immediate area.

How it Works: 
We used google maps and google places to create a user experience where the user can put in their zipcode and the map will go to the chosen location. 

    The user can then use a set of designated filters to narrow down to the typ of place they would like to study at. 

How we plan to grow it: 
    We plan to grow Spotty to be able to accomodate user ratings and input to expand the filter options. 
Examples:   
    - Outlet accesibilty 
    - Better for large or small groups
    - Noise level
    - Food / Beverage choice
    - Able to reserve tables





About Spotty:
Spotty was born from the growing frustration of students and remote workers alike. Coming into
this world with the sole purpose of helping those with hectic home lives, desperate caffein
addictions to fuel those tedious house and a safe place to go to work in groups so no one
has to sacrifice their personal space.Though Spotty might be simple now, it has big dreams. Dreams to be able to direct these
wayward students to places that truly meet their every need. To be able to point them towards
a location with just the right number of outlets, or to a place with just the right ratio
of noise to quiet. Whatever your particular study preferances are, Spotty hopes to one day
be able to bring you to your perfect spot.
