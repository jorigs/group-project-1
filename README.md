Project Name - Study Spot Finder

Team Members - Alex Melda/Justin Adams/Dave Cresson/Derek Gambill/Jordan Rigsby

Project Description – Our project goal is to craft an app that utilizes features from Yelp and Google Maps to aid users in locating the best places to study.  The app will filter through locations based upon specific criteria and present the user with a list of locations to choose from.  The user will be able to look through more information, distance, pictures, reviews, features such as wifi, food and drink, etc before determining a location.  After making a selection, the user will be directed to google maps for directions to the location.
